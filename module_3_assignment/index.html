		   This recipe is a mild or less spicy paneer based curry. as the name suggests, shahi which means royal due to the use of cream in it. consequently, with the use of the cream, it would lower the spice level and thus offering a creamy and a rich paneer gravy. i personally not a huge fan of such mild gravy and i tend to order or make spicy kadai paneer or paneer tikka masala. yet there is a huge fan following who, particularly outside of india where many prefer less spicy meals. in addition to it, some prefer to have mild spicy and sweetness in their curry and this recipe is an ideal choice for them.Anyway, before wrapping up some tips, suggestions and variations for shahi paneer ki sabji. firstly, in this recipe, i have used tomatoes and onions to prepare the creamy sauce. some prefer to use just onions and skip tomatoes to get the yellow colour. but i like my gravy to be reddish or orangish in colour and hence i have used both. secondly,you can also add cashews and almonds in terms of dry fruits. you can experiment and add more options like walnuts, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds and pistachios. lastly, you can make the same gravy sauce and replace the paneer with other ingredients like mushroom and potatoes to make other variants. moreover, you can also use meat chunks to make meat-based shahi gravy.i have posted other similar paneer recipes collection which has a similar texture and taste to this shahi paneer masala recipe. it mainly includes recipes like, paneer hyderabadi, paneer ghee roast, paneer fried rice, paneer biryani, paneer butter masala, malai barfi, paneer frankie, matar paneer, paneer tikka masala, paneer chilla. further to these i would also like to highlight my other detailed recipes collection.(<a href="#chola">Back to up</a>)
